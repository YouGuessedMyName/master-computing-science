ALLOC INT (<size>, <id>) for allocating <size> many integer elements and initialising 
    them with 0s and allocating a reference counter with an initial value of 1.

COPY DATA (<size>, <from-id>, <to-id>) for copying <size> many integer elements 
    from the memory pointed to by <from-id> to the memory pointed to by <to-id>.

INC RC (<id>, <num>) for incrementing the reference counter of the array <id> by
    the value <num>.

DEC RC (<id>, <num>) for decrementing the reference counter of the array <id> by
    the value <num> and potentially freeing the memory in case the reference counter
    reaches 0.

RC (<id>) for reading the reference counter of the array <id>

SIZE (<id>) for obtaining the size of the array <id> (in elements)
    You can use <id>[<num>] for denoting data selections in C and <id>[<num>] =
    <expr>; for denoting destructive updates in C. 
    You can omit all variable declarations
